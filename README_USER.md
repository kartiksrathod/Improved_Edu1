## 🛡️ How It Works

1. **MongoDB uses persistent storage** (`/data/db`)
   - Your data NEVER gets deleted
   - Survives container restarts
   - Survives agent sleeping

2. **Auto-backup every 5 minutes**
   - 35 backups currently available
   - Stored in `/app/backups/`

3. **Auto-restore if needed**
   - Automatically restores data if database becomes empty
   - Smart logic - won't interfere with normal operations
