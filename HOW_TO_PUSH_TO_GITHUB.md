## 🔐 If You Need to Push Manually

**Note:** Manual git push requires authentication. Emergent's "Save to GitHub" handles this automatically.

But if you want to do it manually:

### Step 1: Stage Your Changes
```bash
cd /app
git add .
```

### Step 2: Commit Your Changes
```bash
git commit -m "Clean up repository structure

- Remove 30+ duplicate documentation files
- Organize docs in /docs directory
- Create professional README.md
- Update .gitignore rules
- Remove test files from root
- Improve project structure"
```

### Step 3: Push to GitHub
```bash
git push origin main
```

**If it asks for credentials:**
- Use your GitHub username
- For password, use a **Personal Access Token** (not your GitHub password)

---

## 🔑 GitHub Personal Access Token (If Needed)

If git asks for authentication:

1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name: "Emergent App Push"
4. Select scopes: ✅ `repo` (full control)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. Copy the token (it looks like: `ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxx`)
7. Use this as your password when pushing
